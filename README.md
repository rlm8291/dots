# DOTS INSTALLER

After seeing DHH setup Omarchy I wanted to jump in. I've been using sway for a while now and figured it was about time to setup my own installer. Also wanted to use hyprland, the new fancy wm. 

A couple things to note though:
* Yes, I do use themes set by DHH. I think some of the theming work is fantastic!!!
* No, I do not use all of the defaults. Partially why I'm not installing Omarchy directly!! I have a lot of the respect for the project but this project here is for me.
* There's several projects I'd like to highlight in giving me inspiration for the dots configuration:
    * [Omarchy](https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/tree/master)
    * [rofi-themes](https://github.com/newmanls/rofi-themes-collection)
    * [Silent SDDM Theme](https://github.com/uiriansan/SilentSDDM)

# Wallpapers TBD
